Hello all, 

It's been a while. Just wanted to pop back in with a small project I started on Codepen. With the way the most blog/publishing platforms are designing content pages, there is a quite a bit of unused room on the right. Often, that space is used for ads in order to create revenue for the site. I think a better thing is to add comments to the side that coincide with certain parts of the post. Then you could embed ads in-between the comment sections. I've made the beginning of something that could be used for this, but I'm still working on it. The link here shows a simply jQuery button displays the HTML from the div below the blogpost. This will definitely be a long-term project though. I'd love to make it a bit prettier and more intuitive over time.
