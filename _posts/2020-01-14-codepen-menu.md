Today's project was focused on this week's challenge from Codepen. The challenge requirements are 
typically pretty simple which means there is a whole lot of room for variety in how you solve the problem. This week's challenge was to create a nav menu that filled the whole page. The way that I went about it was to make a menu that connects by sliding in from the top and bottom of the screen. Then there was triple highlighting and a exit button near the middle. I have the tendency to continue to add and tweak things as time goes on so for now I created something simple. This would be just for a desktop experience. For a mobile one. It would make more sense for there to be one column that could probably just fade in and out with a jQuery toggle.
