For today's project I decided to not use any library...unless you want to count
Font Awesome's library for the arrow icons. Today's project was centered around
thinking about how UX and UI meld together. We want to give users a nice experience
and we want them to have a good experience. I once read somewhere that good design
is when the user isn't aware that it's good. It means that the ease of use is built
into the experience. So for this, I worked with css animations for the arrows
and some anchor links for the sections, each of which is covers the window size
automatically. The elements for the example were centered with arrows on the same place
on each side. The animations were included to give the user further aid as to what the
elements do. One of things that I've been recently considering from a user perspective
is giving aid to the use of certain aspects of the website by adding small things
like animations to move users towards certain actions that add to the ease of the experience
and thereby giving them a better experience with the website. This is also why I thought it
would be good to include a progress bar. One frustrating part of the modern web experience
is not knowing where you are in the content. This is a great and yet simple way to measure
progress for things like blog pages. Overall I think it was pretty good for a small project.
 We'll see how tomorrow's goes. See ya then!
