It's been quite a while since I posted an update. Crazy year so far. One of the
things that I wanted to do despite the craziness of this year is to code for myself.
I feel as though it is important, in a way to take ownership of my own skills
and to achieve a side vision of financial freedom/independence. That all starts with some
small steps. Hence, how I thought about doing micro projects. To me these aren't
full websites or complicated ideas. They're simple things I can do almost daily
with the dual task of helping me become more familiar with technologies I've
felt I didn't have the time to learn as well as allowing me to brush up skills
that I may not use everyday for work but am still interesting in digging into.
The first microproject I thought of was button animations. I believe it was
Google's material design that popularized the "ripple" effect when buttons are clicked.

I wanted to play around with something similar while using to technologies I wasn't familiar with:
css variables and keyframes. I ended created a simple hover animation that infinite loops through
changing background, text, and border colors.

One of the stipulations of this experiment with micro projects is that I'm only
allowed to spend two hours on it. I think constraints help with creativity.
We'll have to wait and see how it pans out in the long run.
