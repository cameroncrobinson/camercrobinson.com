      <description>Hello all,
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. Just wanted to pop back in with a small project I started on Codepen. With the way the most blog/publishing platforms are designing content pages, there is a quite a bit of unused room on the right. Often, that space is used for ads in order to create revenue for the site. I think a better thing is to add comments to the side that coincide with certain parts of the post.</description>
