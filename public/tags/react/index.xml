      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now begun the process of moving my blog over to Gatsbyjs. Gatsby is build using react and is more like a static PWA than anything else. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to get started developing in React and is proving to be a fun little project. I will eventually be using Gatsby for another project as well. For now, I wanted to use it for a personal project to slowly get comfortable with it.</description>

      <description>My main focuses right now are PHP, ASP.NET CORE and React. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m taking the basic stuff I&amp;rsquo;m learning about PHP and building stuff right away with it. Going through the entire course on Team Treehouse without building anything has led to me getting discouraged and feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m not learning fast enough. I&amp;rsquo;m finding that practically buiilding and changing a project of my own as learn with the videos does a lot to keep me encouraged.</description>
